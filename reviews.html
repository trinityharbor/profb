This experience has been like a "rebirth" for me. I have a deep concern about the number of students who have a fear of math and who are failing math. I strongly recommend the Professor B Math Program to all teachers, parents, and students. This in the ONLY way to rescue our students. It never fails that when I use the strategies with my students, they say "Oh! I get it now!" That's priceless and that's what I look forward to everywhere I go. It works! All math teachers need to experience the Professor B Power Learning Institute...it will change the way you teach math and you will ultimately experience success like never before with your students. Thank God for Professor B!!!"</span></p><p class="ContentLeftAlignText" style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'; word-spacing: 2px; line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(239, 239, 239);">Johnette R.

His interactive CD that is used in the classroom and at home with children and their parents MAKES SENSE. It is fun and educational. Children master concepts and move progressively through the first CD all the way through the third, over their elementary school experience. Our children have excelled on the Stanford Achievement Tests in the math procedures and the math problem solving sections. Actually, there are things that our children are learning, using his methodologies, that aren't measured on the national tests-but they are critical foundation blocks. So we are excited about what the future holds for our students as they progress through his system. Professor B is passionate about unlocking children's capacity to learn and love math. His methods are fun for students, teachers, and parents alike."</span></p><p class="ContentLeftAlignText" style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'; word-spacing: 2px; line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(239, 239, 239);">Irene M.

At this time, C.A.R.E. had received a grant from the Rural Trust Foundation to see if the school climate could be changed and if mathematics scores, on the Stanford Achievement Test at North Sumter Junior High School in the Sumter County Alabama School District, could be improved. North Sumter scored 28 out of a possible 99 in mathematics on the Stanford Achievement Test. During mid-year, Professor B was introduced into the school. The school was on alert status, if they remained on alert, they would be taken over by the state. The school was desperate to have assistance. During the 1999-2000 year, Professor B's Mathematics Program was implemented in North Sumter Junior High School on a regular basis. This is not just a theoretical discourse about the possibilities that all children can learn at a high level, rather it is the practical, I have seen it for myself, type of discourse. In 2000-2001, the 3rd graders at North Sumter scored 74 in mathematics. This was a phenomenal increase in just one and a half years.</span></p><p class="ContentLeftAlignText" style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'; word-spacing: 2px; line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(239, 239, 239);">Rhoda E.
