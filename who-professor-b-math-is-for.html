				<h3>“Professor B was so instrumental in my learning in my own education as a mathematics teacher.”</h3>

				<p>
					I saw him at a National Council for Teachers of Mathematics conference in New Orleans in 2004. My brain exploded so much during that session and I literally could not sleep that night. I was one who did well in math. I was the student who did what the teacher said and could make the A on the tests and I could do the procedures. But, even as a math educator, <span style="font-weight: bold">THE WHY</span> WAS NOT THERE for me, (in many instances). He talked about the contextual learner and using stories to help students make connections and build meaning, rather than learning by rote memorization, such as with math facts. [Dr. Barrett] unlocked something for me and I just hope for more people to experience what I experienced.

				Everard was commissioned to a UNESCO mission in mathematics education at the request of foreign governments in 1980. Following the World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien, Thailand during March, 1990, he was invited to present his methodology at the first seminar held by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in its search for "fresh, theoretically grounded methodologies for addressing fundamental educational requirements" (such as those identified at Jomtien) The one and one-half day session, on "Innovative Approaches to Meeting Basic Learning Needs" was convened at UNDP Headquarters, New York, in January, 1991. Everard was one of four presenters. Participants were educational specialists and program staff from international agencies such as UNDP. UNESCO, the World Bank, UNICEF, bilateral agencies and institutes. The Director of UNESCO's International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) attended throughout the duration of the seminar.
				<br>
				The directors of IIEP and UNDP were sufficiently influenced by his presentation to refer him to the Chief of the Regional Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean, for the purpose of initiating a UNDP-sponsored project in Jamaica, W.I.
				<br>
				The pilot phase of the project was completed during Summer, 1992. After receiving training in Everard's methodology, sixteen mathematics lecturers from local Teachers' Colleges enabled 94% of 265 practicing primary teachers to pass a qualifying examination in mathematics which the vast majority of them had failed repeatedly. The teachers received instruction from the lecturers for five days per week through five weeks. The highest passing rate ever achieved previously (since 1981), by a similar population of primary teachers under the same circumstances, was only 20%. In fact, the highest passing rate ever achieved previously by a population of mixed ability was 60%. By means of similar projects during the Summers of 1993 and 1994, the remaining population of practicing teachers unqualified to teach was reduced to an insignificantly small number. A national problem has been solved.

			Dr. Everard Barrett, the creator and founder of Professor B Math, was commissioned to a UNESCO mission in mathematics education at the request of foreign governments in 1980.
			<br>
			After a captivating presentation to participants of the inaugural seminar held by the United Nations Development Program, Dr. Barrett was invited to complete a pilot project in Jamaica with the intention of enabling primary teachers to pass the qualifying exam in mathematics, which boasted a dismal 20% passing rate.
			<br>
			By the end of the summer in 1992, after 
			instruction and immersion in Dr. Barrett’s
