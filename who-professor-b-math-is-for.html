		<div class="one text-center">
			<img src="/assets/finger.png" width="150" height="150">
			<h2>No rote memorization </h2>
			<p>
				Professor B methodology does not rely on strict memorization - only meaningful strategies! Kids see the mathematical concepts strongly <b>connected from one to the next</b>, as they develop new skills.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two text-center">
			<img src="/assets/brain.png" width="150" height="150">
			<h2>Based on neuroscience</h2>
			<p>The research shows kids find math <b>easier and easier to learn</b> as their brain gets stronger! Professor B focuses on stimulating and developing the parts of the brain needed to learn math:  the parietal and prefrontal lobes of the brain. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="three text-center">
			<img src="/assets/book.png" width="150" height="150">
			<h2>Power of Story</h2>
			<p><i>Compelling language creates context and meaning.</i> Professor B uses the power of story to connect meaning and develop a student’s ability to <b>verbally explain connections and relationships between math skills</b>.</p>

		<p style="line-height: 1.8">
			Dr. Everard Barrett, the creator and founder of Professor B Math, was commissioned to a UNESCO mission in mathematics education at the request of foreign governments in 1980.
			<br>
			After a captivating presentation to participants of the inaugural seminar held by the United Nations Development Program, Dr. Barrett was invited to complete a pilot project in Jamaica with the intention of enabling primary teachers to pass the qualifying exam in mathematics, which boasted a dismal 20% passing rate.
			<br>
			By the end of the summer in 1992, after 
			instruction and immersion in Dr. Barrett’s 
			methodology, the passing rate was 94%. By the end of 1994, the passing rate was over 99%. 
			<br>
			A national teaching crisis had been solved.
