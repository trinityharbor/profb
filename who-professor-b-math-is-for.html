	<h2>WHY PROFESSOR B MATH WORKS</h2>
	<div class="perks-row">
		<div class="one text-center">
			<img src="" width="150" height="150">
			<h2>No rote memorization </h2>
			<p>
				Professor B methodology does not rely on strict memorization - only meaningful strategies! Kids see the mathematical concepts strongly <b>connected from one to the next</b>, as they develop new skills.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two text-center">
			<img src="" width="150" height="150">
			<h2>Based on neuroscience</h2>
			<p>The research shows kids find math <b>easier and easier to learn</b> as their brain gets stronger! Professor B focuses on stimulating and developing the parts of the brain needed to learn math:  the parietal and prefrontal lobes of the brain. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="three text-center">
			<img src="" width="150" height="150">
			<h2>Power of Story</h2>
			<p><i>Compelling language creates context and meaning.</i> Professor B uses the power of story to connect meaning and develop a student’s ability to <b>verbally explain connections and relationships between math skills</b>.</p>

		<h2>The “A-Ha” Moment Behind Why Math Skills Work</h2>
		<h3>Oral rehearsal</h3>
		<p>Kids do the talking! Social learning theory <b>WORKS</b> and oral rehearsal is how it happens. </p>
		<h3>Scripted and self-paced</h3>
		<p>The <b>word-for-word scripts</b> provided for the teacher allows for manageable classroom pacing and maximum results. </p>
		<h3>Interactive and fun</h3>
		<p>No boring busy work! Ideal for <i>struggling learners AND accelerated whiz kids</i>. The lessons are all multi-sensory and provide <b>multiple strategies for each skill</b>.</p>
